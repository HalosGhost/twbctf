"The World's Best C Test Framework" is a small header and source file that adds all the basics you need for a C test framework.

All you need to do is edit ``tests.h`` to include your test functions (or headers that you need), modify the included ``Tuprules.tup`` (if the test suite will need to link against anything) and run ``tup upd``!
